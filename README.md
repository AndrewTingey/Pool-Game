# Pool-Game

This was one of the first personal projects I ever made back in sophomore year of highschool. I didn't know much about graphic design so I used a literal jpeg image of my own pool table back home for the background. 

It's very buggy and could use a lot of updates, but I find it nostalgic as evidence of how far we've come.

I haven't updated it since
